# omsf-directory
This site hosts a directory of software and workflows for molecular software projects and workflows.

## Adding a new project
You can directly add the YAML needed to either the `software` or `workflows` directory.
If you need help generating this YAML, take a look at our new project creator at [https://directory.omsf.io/new](https://directory.omsf.io/new)!
Create a PR with the file you create and an example site will be generated in CI for you to preview! Once merged, the site will auto-deploy with new changes.

## Software Used
This site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).
This allows for us to build a dynamic site that functions like a static site.
